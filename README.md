# 7-DOF Parallel Robotic System for Precision Eye Surgery

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and analysis of a 7-degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) parallel robotic system tailored for precision eye surgery. By leveraging advanced mechanical design principles, this robotic system aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of eye surgeries, thereby addressing critical needs in ophthalmic care.

The repository contains the CAD files for the robotic system's components, providing a comprehensive view of the mechanical design and facilitating further research and development.
